## About

The `ViGEmBus` driver and `ViGEmClient` libraries represent the core of the Virtual Gamepad Emulation Framework (or `ViGEm` , for short). `ViGEm` aims for a 100% accurate [emulation](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emulator>) of well-known gaming peripherals as pure software-based devices at kernel level. As it mimics "the real thing" games and other processes require no additional modification whatsoever to detect `ViGEm`-based devices (no Proxy-DLLs or API-Hooking) and simply work out of the box. While the (now obsolete) [Scarlett.Crush Productions Virtual Bus Driver](<https://github.com/nefarius/ScpVBus>) is the spiritual father of this project, `ViGEm` has been designed and written from the ground up utilizing Microsoft's [Kernel-Mode Driver Framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel-Mode_Driver_Framework).

### Emulated devices

Currently supports emulation of the following USB Gamepads:

- [Microsoft Xbox 360 Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xbox_360_controller)
- [Sony DualShock 4 Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DualShock#DualShock_4)

## Use cases

A few examples of the most common use cases for `ViGEm` are:

- You have an unsupported input device you'd like to use within games without modifying said game.
- You want the freedom to use a different controller of your choice in [PS4 Remote Play](<https://remoteplay.dl.playstation.net/remoteplay/>).
- You encountered a game not compatible with [x360ce](<https://www.x360ce.com/>) (prior to version 4.x).
- You want to extend the reach of your input device (like send traffic to a different machine over a network).
- You want to test/benchmark your game and need a replay mechanism for your user inputs.
- You want to work around player slot assignment order issues in `XInput`.

## Supported Systems

The driver is built for Windows 7/8.1/10 (x86 and amd64).

## How to build

[Install Visual Studio 2019 and WDK for Windows 10, version 1903](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/download-the-wdk#wdk-for-windows-10-version-1903).

You can build directly within Visual Studio.

Do bear in mind that you'll need to **sign** the driver to use it without [test mode](<https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/ff553484(v=vs.96)>).
